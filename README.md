# Sudoku Game

## TODO:

- Fix all broken tests
- Remove Matrix class (not really needed; we could have an array with 81 cells)
- Change Board class so that it stops re-printing the DOM and updates it instead
- Add event handlers receiving inputs from the keyboard (and hide keyboard element for desktop users)
- Save state of the board in local storage
- Move main.css to LESS

## Features:
- Multiple platforms
- Native experience
